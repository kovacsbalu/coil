Version 0.3.?
=============

  - Extend Struct.update() to support recursive updates.
  - Store charset info in Struct to aid converting unicode back to str
  - Extend documentation to cover more of the API, particularly details
    about Struct.expand and related operations.

Future Ideas ?
==============

  - re-add support for @factory
  - how to deal with package imports from zips/eggs/non-filesystem import?
  - importing of directories
  - Interfaces indicating schema information (maybe @provides, @type, or?)
    - Ability to check for schema conformance
    - UI for editing configuration ??
  - Operators:
    foo: {
        @extends: =..bar
        value: =..bar.value + 2
    }
