== Short term ==

- @file on top level of file seems to be buggy
- add file/lineno to StructAttributeError
- speed up by removing deepcopying
- Debugging tools, e.g. tool that dumps loaded text file/verifies well-formedness as a side-effect
- More tests
- Better names
- Text format:
  - make comments into a special attribute type
  - Multi-line strings, maybe
- Serialization of Python objects to text format
- Ability to compare structs


== Long Term ==

- how to deal with package imports from zips/eggs/non-filesystem import?
- importing of directories
- Interfaces indicating schema information (@provides on structs),
  which can be adapted to factories when @factory is missing
  - Ability to check for schema conformance
  - UI for editing configuration
- Configuration mutation?
- Operators:
    foo: {
        @extends: =..bar
        value: =..bar.value + 2
    }
