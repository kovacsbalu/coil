== Short term ==

- More tests
- Better names
- Text format:
  - String quoting
  - Extending of other structs
  - Importing
  - Multi-line strings, maybe
- Serialization of Python objects to text format
- Ability to compare structs


== Long Term ==

- Interfaces indicating schema information (@provides on structs),
  which can be adapted to factories when @factory is missing
  - Ability to check for schema conformance
  - UI for editing configuration
- Configuration mutation?
- Operators:
    foo extends bar: {
        value: bar:value + 2
    }
