Coil: A Vaporware Configuration System


Design goals:

- Support non-Twisted reactor driven Python programs

- Scalable to complex configurations

- Scalable to many machines; for example, 50 machines that have almost
  same config with only minor changes to each should be easy to do.

- Orthogonal to code; code should not be required to know about the
  config system used, it should be regular Python or Twisted code

- Encourage design of code to be easily extendable and pluggable and
  not tightly coupled

- Encourage creation of pre-made configuration libraries

- Minimal boilerplate

- Python object representation for automatic code generation as well
  as human editable text format which is not code (James pointed out
  how this is helpful, e.g. binding to pre-1024 ports, then changing
  uid, without actually importing any user code)

- Maybe? Changeable at runtime; if not in first revision, should be
kept in mind for further enhancement


Outside the scope:

- Distributed configuration (configuration that spans more than one
  process)

- Generic data editing; e.g. credentialchecker user editing tools
  would not be covered, but choosing which checker to use and for say
  a passwd format checker which file to point it would be in scope of
  project
