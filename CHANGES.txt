Version 0.3.1 (2009-03-15)
==========================

  - Change Struct.__getattr__ and friends to behave exactly like
    Struct.get, allowing access to arbitrary paths.

  - Fix the tokenizer and parser to allow None as a value.

  - Drop expansion support from Struct.set and make it private.

  - Add new Struct.expand method to expand all Links and in-string
    variables recursively over the entire tree.

  - Default values given to any expansion methods are now only used if
    the value is missing from the tree rather than overriding them.

  - Switch from the 'silent' argument to 'ignore' for all expansion
    methods and allow it to take a specific list of names that can
    be ignored.

  - Allow the Parser and the parsing helper functions to pass default
    values and ignore options to Struct.expand.

Version 0.3.0 (2009-02-10)
==========================

  Changes since 0.2.2:

  - All inheritance, links, and string variable expansions are performed
    immediately after parsing, ensuring that broken links and other
    errors are reported as soon as possible. String variable expansion
    may also happen at run time if desired.

  - The text format now allows a struct to inherit from any number of
    other structs. This allows large configurations to be broken into
    separate files and then merged back together with a set of @file
    directives.

  - Struct now features a complete dict-like interface and understands
    containers, removing the need for StructNode. The old StructNode
    class is still provided as a simple wrapper around Struct for
    backwards compatibility.

  - Support for variable expansion within strings, for example: "${foo}"
    All relative and absolute (@root) paths are supported. This is a
    change from previous coil extensions which were more limited,
    requiring programs to change the root rather than simply allowing
    parent references.

  - Easily convert between dict and Struct objects.

  - Struct objects may be modified at run time just like a normal dict.

  - Struct's get and set methods may reference any relative or absolute
    path in the tree.

  - More exception types with clearer error messages to ease
    troubleshooting. This is a work in progress.
