Version 0.3.0
=============

  Changes since 0.2.2:

  - All inheritance, links, and string variable expansions are performed
    immediately after parsing, ensuring that broken links and other
    errors are reported as soon as possible. String variable expansion
    may also happen at run time if desired.

  - Struct now features a complete dict-like interface and understands
    containers, removing the need for StructNode. The old StructNode
    class is still provided as a simple wrapper around Struct for
    backwards compatibility.

  - Support for variable expansion within strings, for example: "${foo}"
    All relative and absolute (@root) paths are supported. This is a
    change from previous coil extensions which were more limited,
    requiring programs to change the root rather than simply allowing
    parent references.

  - Easily convert between dict and Struct objects.

  - Struct objects may be modified at run time just like a normal dict.

  - Struct's get and set methods may reference any relative or absolute
    path in the tree.

  - More exception types with clearer error messages to ease
    troubleshooting. This is a work in progress.
